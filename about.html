      Hey! Here you can try our delicious chocolate-chipped cookies. We started
      our journey of making <em>Cookies</em> two years ago. Being acknowledged for
      my baking talent by several friends and acquaintance, I decided to open
      a store for cookie lover. I along with my boyfriend tried to present the
      delecacy of cookies with a variety of home-styled recipes of my own.

      <em>I welcome you to my wonderland of Cookies.</em>
